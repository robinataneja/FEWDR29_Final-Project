        Refund Policy
      </h1>
        <p>We have a 14-day return policy, which means you have 14 days after receiving <br> your item to request a return. <br>
          <br>
          To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition <br>
          that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You’ll <br>
          also need the receipt or proof of purchase. <br>
          <br>
          To start a return, you can contact us at roohi.homedecor@gmail.com. If your <br>
          return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as well as instructions <br>
          on how and where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first <br>
          requesting a return will not be accepted. You will need to pay for your own <br>
          return shipping. <br>
          <br>
          You can always contact us for any return question at <br>
          roohi.homedecor@gmail.com. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Damages and issues</h3>
        <p>
          Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the item <br>
          is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate <br>
          the issue and make it right. <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Exchanges</h3>
        <p>
          The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, <br>
          and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item. <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>
          We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you <br>
          know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically <br>
          refunded on your original payment method. Please remember it can take some <br>
          time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too. <br>
